Humans without HIV:

- Protein-protein interactions are balanced and regulated, allowing cells to function normally.
- Immune system proteins interact with each other to:
    - Recognize and eliminate pathogens (like bacteria or viruses).
    - Repair damaged tissues.
    - Maintain cellular homeostasis.
- Cellular proteins interact with each other to:
    - Regulate gene expression.
    - Maintain cellular metabolism.
    - Support cellular growth and division.

Humans with HIV:

- HIV disrupts normal protein-protein interactions, leading to an imbalance in cellular function.
- HIV proteins interact with human proteins to:
    - Hijack cellular machinery for viral replication.
    - Evade immune recognition.
    - Disrupt cellular metabolism.
- Immune system proteins are altered, leading to:
    - Impaired recognition and elimination of HIV.
    - Chronic inflammation.
    - Immune exhaustion.
- Cellular proteins are altered, leading to:
    - Disrupted gene expression.
    - Impaired cellular metabolism.
    - Accelerated cellular aging.

Key differences:

- Balance and regulation: In healthy individuals, protein-protein interactions are balanced and regulated. In HIV-infected individuals, HIV disrupts this balance, leading to an overactive or underactive immune response.
- Immune recognition: In healthy individuals, immune proteins recognize and eliminate pathogens. In HIV-infected individuals, HIV evades immune recognition, allowing the virus to persist.
- Cellular function: In healthy individuals, cellular proteins interact to maintain normal cellular function. In HIV-infected individuals, HIV disrupts cellular function, leading to impaired metabolism, growth, and division
